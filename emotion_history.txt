Text: One afternoon, as the children prepared a makeshift obstacle course out of boxes and chalk lines, a sudden windstorm blew through the courtyard. Papers flew, chalk dust filled the air, and the smallest child, Emily, lost her backpack in the commotion. The children searched everywhere, but the wind had pushed the backpack beyond the yard, down a narrow path leading toward the woods.
